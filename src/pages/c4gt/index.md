  - text: Code for GovTech (C4GT) is an ecosystem initiative to build an open-source
      community of contributors, mentors and organizations around Digital Public
      Goods (DPG), Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Tech for Good
      products â€“ innovations that are shaping the technological revolution
      globally to drive the mission of DPG / DPI in the attainment of the
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  - text: "C4GT conducts a Dedicated Mentoring Program (DMP) annually wherein select
      contributors (students or working professionals) work on open-source
      projects in the DPG / DPI / Tech for Good domain with 1:1 mentorship from
      domain experts. It is a 3-month long coding program offering a generous
      stipend to the contributor at the end of the program. The Dedicated
      Mentoring Program 2023 saw participation from 20+ organizations, listing
      100+ problem statements spanning across 38 different open-source products.
      "
  - text: Beyond this, we have a community of 18,000+ (and counting) contributors on
      our Discord channel, working on open-source products. In 2023, we also
      started setting up Code for GovTech offices to build ground-up,
      decentralized communities of contributors. Currently, we are present
      across 18 colleges in India, including IITs, IIITs and NITs.
