      State Public Works Departments (SPWDs) are an essential, if often ignored,
      cog in the governance machinery of the country. As the departments in
      charge of creating and maintaining critical infrastructure like public
      roads and buildings, SPWDs play a critical role in ensuring that other
      departments like education, health and tourism can effectively provide
      their services to citizens. In 2019, the Odisha Works Department (OWD)
      gave Samagra the mandate to design an approach for transforming the
      department in line with the Odisha Chief Ministerâ€™s 5T (Technology,
      Teamwork, Transparency, Time, Transformation) framework for improving
      governance in the state. Broadly, this meant breaking down the mandate
      into three objectives: to improve timeliness, reduce costs and improve
      citizen satisfaction with OWD projects.

      Over four months, the Samagra team diagnosed OWD's complete project
      execution value chain, from selection of the right projects, project
      financing, project design, tendering, construction, to maintenance.
      Simultaneously, the team also assessed the Department's organization
      structure, HR policies and processes, and governance mechanisms. The team
      completed its diagnosis and provided OWD with 36 key recommendations to
      transform the department, several of which are currently under
      implementation.
