title4: What was the journey of Saksham Phase 1 in the Governance Matrix?
newsdescription1: "In our view, the education system of Haryana, from 2017-2020
  (pre COVID), witnessed a shift from being ‘Comatose’ with low ‘political
  salience’ and low ‘system capacity’ to ‘Battle Ready’ with high ‘political
  salience’ and high ‘system capacity.’  The Saksham Haryana (Education)
  initiative, spearheaded by the Chief Minister, aimed to make 80% students
  grade-level competent in the elementary grades in the state. This shift was
  propelled by increased attention to education, evident in the state's
  performance in ASER and NAS surveys.  Increased political salience, led to
  system capacity being built over the 3 year period with reforms on the
  process, people and infrastructural fronts. At the process front, key changes
  included- digitizing all education data, revamping assessments for
  competency-based learning, delivering competency based remediation support and
  ensuring timely textbook delivery. This was further complemented by cascaded
  and data-backed reviews at district and block levels. At the people front,
  administrative and academic levers were strengthened. Online and transparent
  teacher recruitment and transfers were implemented, the school mentoring cadre
  was strengthened and teacher training was enhanced so as to be centered around
  pedagogy techniques for outcome achievement. At the infrastructure level,
  learning materials were upgraded and digital infrastructure was developed to
  aid the aforementioned processes.  Additionally, direct involvement of the
  Chief Minister through quarterly reviews and gamification strategies like
  Saksham Goshna fostered accountability and shared vision among stakeholders,
  making the system Battle Ready. "
