title4: What was the journey of Antyodaya Saral in the Governance Matrix?
newsdescription1: "In our view, scheme and service delivery in Haryana shifted
  from being ‘Sleeping Giant’ with low ‘political salience’ and high ‘system
  capacity’ to ‘Battle Ready’ with high ‘political salience’ and high ‘system
  capacity’. The system already had decent capacity with a well-oiled NIC with
  strong leadership and decent work on e-District implementation in the state
  under which some schemes/services had been made accessible at the
  district/subdivision/tehsil level in physical centres. Further investment was
  made in system capacity especially on technology front by building an online
  platform that could be used directly and in assisted mode. Further capacity
  was built on physical infrastructure front where physical centres were
  revamped - made state of the art & single window. Processes were put in place
  to run this strengthened system. Political salience for transforming schemes
  and service delivery in Haryana increased from 2017 to 2018 leading to the
  launch of Antyodaya Saral as an initiative which further streamlined the
  scheme-service delivery in Haryana. "
